# CV Assignment 1 Bag of Visual Words

### Abstract
The bag of visual words (BoVW) is a popular method for image
classification and recognition that extracts features from images and
represents them as visual words. In this task we first extract the
features from the images then we generate a visual vocabulary as
known as Codebook Generation, lastly we train two classifiers, one
using Support Vector Machines and the other one using Random Forest. We work on two datasets in this task, Objects Dataset and
Flowers Dataset and perform these tasks for both these datasets.

#### Instructions to Run the Code

First copy the files Joblibs on your machine.
Then Import the mentioned libraries and dependencies in the code.
Then load the Joblibs mentioned in the codes to load the models.

#### Instructions to Run Train and Test Scripts

The path mentioned in the code needs to be altered to match with where the Datasets are located in your machine in order for this code to work.
