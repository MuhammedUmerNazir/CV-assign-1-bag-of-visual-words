# CV Assignment 1 Bag of Visual Words

### Abstract
The bag of visual words (BoVW) is a popular method for image
classification and recognition that extracts features from images and
represents them as visual words. In this task we first extract the
features from the images then we generate a visual vocabulary as
known as Codebook Generation, lastly we train two classifiers, one
using Support Vector Machines and the other one using Random For-
est. We work on two datasets in this task, Objects Dataset and
Flowers Dataset and perform these tasks for both these datasets.
